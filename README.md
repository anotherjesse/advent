API issues

- [ ] store metadata for projects / pages
- [ ] store prompt or spec for a page?
- [ ] patch should always work in the context of a version
- [ ] generation needs to be re-added

DATA issues

- [ ] re-add files
- [ ] users / orgs / ownership should exist

Open questions:

- can a version have more than 1 parent?  I think so
- should I expose this as git as well?
